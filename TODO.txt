** TODO Improve search
Mark Klein is currently working on this
- [ ] Should make it more "lazy" ie match without having to *exactly* type a name
- [ ] Probably also search for maintainers

** TODO optimize update rpms and gems process
- [ ] Make it fault tolerant
- [ ] Maybe add interactive mode?
  - [ ] Allow one to set update options interactively
  - [ ] Allow one to pause/continue update

** TODO Fix upstream source patched? column
- [ ] Icons should be centred
- [ ] Maybe change icons by something more like Fedora?

** TODO Fill static pages
- [ ] Fill success stories page (maybe ask ruby SIG?)
- [ ] Fill how to contribute page (fork repo, make pull request, join #fedora-ruby on freenode, etc)

** TODO Add decent robots.txt 

** TODO Fix "most wanted gems" (or erase)

** TODO Make tables without content not appear
- [ ] Fedora RPM details dependency table
- [ ] Stats table

** TODO Make a nice error message appear when a user types a wrong URL
-> Example: http://www.isitfedoraruby.com/fedorarpms/non-existent-rpm
- [ ] Make a "non-existent-rpm" RPM does not exist sign
- [ ] It would be totally awesome to have a "did you mean...?" sign

** TODO improve import mechanism
- Instead of scraping websites, we should use the APIs for git, bugzilla,
  koji, fedora, and more

** TODO start writing tests for application

** TODO flush out batch gem conversion mechanism
- The user should be able to convert a gem and all its dependencies
  to rpms and setup a publically accessible yum repository with one
  click of a button
- May require improvements to gem2rpm

** TODO flush out automated conversion mechanism
- We can hook into the rubygems API to automatically run commands
  such as gem2rpm on gem updates
- May require improvements to gem2rpm

** TODO gamification: implement badges for a maintainers contributions

** TODO writeup content for the success stories and contribute sections
