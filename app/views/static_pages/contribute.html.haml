Packaging Ruby libraries and applications for Fedora is still in its infancy, and only very few RPMs are available. We hope that this situation will improve dramatically over the next few months; that means that you, dear reader, can become a hero by packaging your favorite piece of Ruby code as an RPM and <a href=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/Join>submitting it to Fedora</a>.").html_safe
